So basically as the title describes I was stopped on Saturday night by the police and searched. I told them before they started that I had it on me didn't see the point in lying. Just a bit worried what will happen? Does anyone know the consequences? If this isn't allowed i do apologise. Thanks in advance. So, it's been about four years since I released my gear guide to the masses, and it seems to have done well. I was recently approached by a member of the community to do some revisions after getting more experience and crunching the numbers. A significant amount of it is still the same, as I believe a lot of the core gear is stuff you can grab out of the CRB. That's not to say expansions aren't helpful and great for building characters, but this guide is designed for what a every character. I bought a custom built laptop off ebay and although it runs games better than my previous laptop there is this horrible input lag that makes every game unplayable. I played Skyrim, Left4dead, Killing floor etc. and I've used a few different gamepads as well as a mouse and keyboard but the problem still persists. There's even lag with keyboard movements. I'm thinking that the problem is my graphics card/processor( are those the same thing? Idk i'm not really a computer guy). The graphics propert.

I need help with getting iGPU (uhd630) working on i9-9900K with Gigabyte z390 Aorus Master. Right after installing Mojave system did start but with no acceleration. Graphics card was detected as "Display 7MB". I changed in clover device-id to 923E000 and AAPL,ig-platform-id to 0000A53E. This made card show as "Intel HD Graphics CFL CRB 1536 MB" (not sure if this is correct) and acceleration works, but there is no video output (I can only get to the system using TeamViewer). Are these values.

Hi, I have installed Arch Linux on my Dual Boot Asus laptop (Model ROG GL552VW) (i5 6300HQ, Intel® HD Graphics 530 and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M) and for some reason whenever i reboot or shutdown the computer it freezes indefinitely forcing me to press and hold the power button. amp#x200B; Here are some of the things I have done trying to fix it: amp#x200B; Adding "reboot=force", "reboot=acpi" and "reboot=cpi" (separately) to the GRUB command line; Using both the latest kernel Mueller’s recommendation for no jail time for General Flynn is reassuring and what QAnon had told us. Time will reveal the true heroic efforts by Mike Flynn in service to POTUS and our fine country. Post Q# 2601 on 12/12/18 (in part): NOBODY IS ABOVE THE LAW. THE WORLD IS WATCHING.

 It seems random, but sometimes it'll just get stuck at the screen with the Fedora logo on it. I usually hold the power button to turn it off, then turn it on again, and it works as though nothing ever happened. I'm on kernel 4.16.11, Fedora 28. I read about some sort of bug in the kernel(?) where it gets stuck due to something about generating secure random numbers (again, not sure, I just read it on this sub). Anyway, here's a snippet from dmesg: ``` 20.015289 ACPI: Video Device. Recently whenever I get to the desktop, my laptop may completely freeze after 5 seconds (Longest amount of time it has lasted was ~5 minutes). Shortcuts (like Ctrl + alt + F1) don't work and both my USB mouse and trackpad become unresponsive. This is on a Dell Inspiron 5577 with Intel HD 630 iGPU and a GTX 1050 that is in an Optimus config. The drivers are the open source ones. (I installed them on KDE Neon, but then I started to get composition issues there) Some background: This is an issue. 
As the title says, I'm running Arch and trying to get the proprietary drivers working. I've tried nvidia, nvidia-lts, and nvidia-beta. For some reason, none of them work. My GPU is a Palit GTX 1060 6GB, and the CUDA drivers are essential to what I use my computer for. Here's the output of dmesg after running systemctl start lightdm: 154.771288 resource sanity check: requesting mem 0x000c0000-0x000fffff , which spans more than PCI Bus 0000:00 mem 0x000c0000-0x000dffff window. Guys from my Kingmaker Campaign, if you are reading this - stop. You'll ruin your and my fun. TL;DR: what feats to take after Augmented Summoning as an Oracle? Legal sources to pick from are: CRB, APG, UC, UM, ARG, UCamp, CampC, QampC. Hello! I'm currently playing an dark tapestry oracle in Kingmaker Campaign. Right now we are at lvl 4; and this is my first character that I put thought to build it mechanically, so it won't suck mechanically (at least - at all), and for this reaso. As most of us know, most of the original Infinity Ward, the people who developed and created the original two Call of Dutys, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, had left the company. With little of the original company remaining, there was doubt the Infinity Ward studio would survive. They hired a completely new team, a mix of old school devs who've been making games for ages to newcomers who have only been in the gaming scene for a little while now. Even though. 
I have a Dell inspiron 15 5000 Gaming late 2017 I have been trying to install Kali Linux on it. To be honest I didn't know if I was supposed to install it to the ssd or the hard drive. When tried to install it I had some issues like, cd-rom isn't mounted, cd-rom data can't be installed. So after fixing the cd-rom problem I went to the Network Installation. When in the Network Installation there were some firmware that I was missing iwlwifi-7265D-29, iwlwifi-7265D-28, iwlwifi-7265D-27,iwlwifi-726. So I'm completely lost when it comes DDST, SSDT, darkwake, etc. I hit the sleep and the monitor goes off and then the computer goes to sleep for a second before it turns back on again. After doing this I can't get the monitor to show anything. I saw a bunch of posts with the same issue but nothing really to fix it besides changing darkwake, which I ended up doing but still get the same issue. If I could get pointed to a guide or helped out here or the discord that would be great. CPU : i7-67. Hi there, i'm trying to get my linux to playback videos without massive framedrops since last week. I tried literally everything but nothing worked. I tried archlinux, gentoo and manjaro and only manjaro was able to display kde. arch linux said that opengl2 can't be properly used and with gento nothing worked. I also tried windows 10 with the offical drivers from lenovo but there too: massive framedrops no matter what kind of video i was trying to play. Could you please help me? EDIT: Cheers, chummers! My group recently started a game that involves gang wars and therefore a lot of people shooting at each other. Throwing down for 10 friendlies against 9 hostiles under standard combat rules would take up the whole session and frag that dreg, so we improvised and then ironed out the kinks. I thought I'd share the results in case anyone wants to have a showdown between big groups and more mechanical backing than "odd - A wins, even - B wins". Long story shortened to: "make.

Any searches I have tried come up with nothing so just wondered if anyone here might know anything more about it / where to find manuals. Thanks. In short , I bought a Mac G4 in 2012 and started modding it in my friends basement. This year, I finally got around to finishing it.

I've just switched from ubuntu to debian and it went pretty smooth for the most part. However, there are three things which I can't figure out. This is what my bootup screen just looked like ( I have windows 10 installed on the beginning of my nvme drive. On the rest I have one LVM volume group for debian with three LVs: root, home, and swap. I'm not sure what's going wrong here, but I hope I can get rid of these warning messages about lvmetad. ###Build Help/Ready: Have you read the sidebar and rules ( (Please do) Yes.

A few days ago I closed my laptop (Dell XPS 13), which will suspend it, as I usually do. The following morning it was out of battery, which might indicate that for some reason it didn't go into sleep mode, because in the past I've had issues with closing the lid but the laptop not sleeping causing overheating, but not on Arch. Anyway, the following day after rechar. 匿名 提到. 之前在chipset廠做時,code都是向BIOS公司拿. 倒是沒看過CRB的目錄.可能是只有 Intel chipset才會用此名詞吧.
